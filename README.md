MEDLES

"We love to build. Watch us build. And, build with us." 

Watch Us Build is an app to help capture and share the building process on site. We've created it as a tool for ourselves. We are currently building a project at 138 N 1st in Brooklyn, NY. We will use this app to document the project from start to finish. We intend to start 'buildbooks' from different perspectives on site, both in and out of the structure, as it is built. The idea is to take photos from the same perspective over a period of time to slowly compile a 'flipbook' of the process. As it is compiled, it will be public so each week the buildbook will develop along with the project itself.

We would like to invite others to signup and use our tool on their projects. 

Use our app to show the world what you're building! 

Build With Us
========  

Signup is simple. Then, connect to your Instagram account. Use Instagram to capture your site photos. When you are ready, start a buildbook! You can add your Instagram photos to it on an ongoing basis. It is our hope that users will make their buildbooks public, so they appear on our homepage, but the option is availabe to keep buildbooks private.

Technical
========

- Instagram integration
- GIF animations
- GIFs stored on Amazon S3

Goals
========

Our goal is to develop a paired mobile app that replaces the current Instagram integration. Our vision to build a simple app that allows users to save locations of buildbooks on site. The app functionality will also include the ability to see an overlay of the previous image taken so that the buildbooks actually render like the original flipbooks; as a linear process captured in one spot over time.
